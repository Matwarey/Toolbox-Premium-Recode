# Toolbox-Premium-Recode
Credits to whoever first made this, submit a issue if there is a problem, also find a Java to Smali converter for it.
Also remove the bridge part from b. (talking about bridgeb.class file)

Story behind how I was able to do this, unconfirmed if this recode works.


a90.class was orignally zf3.class
f2.class was orignally eg3/gg3.class (p2.class is AdLoader)
m70.class was orignally nk3.class
ca0.class was orignally qt3.class
oq0.class was orignally zt3.class
tq0.class was orignally au3.class (unsure, but looks like the same code) 
wt0.class was orignally iu3.class (also looking at it, looks like ah3.class could be io.mrarm.mctoolbox.bridge.b.class after all)


oq0.class, (iq0.class empty with imports), tq0.class, (ut0.class empty with imports) manages premium remaining time somehow (unsure of how this works)
k70.class as a internal error on java decomplier's end. (unfixable on my end, but compiler does mentions it has the string of premium in it)
io.mrarm.mctoolbox.bridge.b.class has hints of premium, this might have been recoded, could be orignally ah3.class


Basically, MrARM did a huge mismatch on his class/smali files, meaning it will be harder to crack premium wise.
I also got word some other people was trying to crack the new premium recode also, but only got up to 15 minutes before crashing.
